# PRBot
PRBot is a simple IRC bot written under Java with the PircBot base.

## Don't understand how to use this?
No problem. I've written up a tutorial on how to setup PRBot and get the dependencies! [Check it out!](http://plusreed.com/site/blog/prbot-setup-instructions/)

## Dependencies
You will need [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [PircBot](http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php/).

## Compiling/Recompiling
**_This is pulled straight from the PircBot website._** <br />
To recompile the changes you have made to a file, execute `javac -classpath pircbot.jar;. *.java`. If there are no errors, then start the IRC bot by executing `java -classpath pircbot.jar;. MyBotMain`
